# Payday 2 Experience Calculator

This is a simple command-line Java program that calculates the experience needed for a player to reach level one hundred from a lower level.

# Motivation

This project was made as a way to help familiarize myself with Visual Studio Code, specifically the integrated Git functionality.

# How To Use

To use the program, first download it. This should place a zipped version of the folder within your Downloads folder or similarly-named folder. Unzip the downloaded folder. Open your command-line interface. Navigate to the folder payday-2-experience-calculator directory. Run the following command:

	java Payday2ExperienceCalculator

You will then be prmopted to enter a number representing your level. Doing so provides you with the amount of experience needed to reach level one hundred. The following is an example of the output in which the number seventy-eight is entered:

	Required Experience: 15,483,215
	You have 33.65% of the required 23,336,413 experience.

Entering "exit" will close the application.
