# Payday 2 Experience Calculator

This is a simple command-line Java program that calculates the experience needed for a player to reach level one hundred from a lower level.

# Motivation

This project was made as a way to help familiarize myself with Visual Studio Code, specifically the integrated Git functionality.

# How To Use

To use the program, first download it. This should place a zipped version of the folder within your Downloads folder or similarly-named folder. Unzip the downloaded folder. Open your command-line interface. Navigate to the folder payday-2-experience-calculator directory. Run the following command followed by the level your profile currently is. (As an example, the number 78 was entered.)

	java Payday2ExperienceCalculator 78

The output will look like the following:

	Required Experience: 15,483,215
	You have 33.65% of the required 23,336,413 experience.
